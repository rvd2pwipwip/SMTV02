# Development Log

## Learning Objectives
- Understand TV app development fundamentals
- Learn spatial navigation patterns
- Master React component architecture for TV
- Develop TV-specific UX considerations
- Implement accessible TV navigation

## Project Setup and Initial Decisions

### Directory Structure
- Created basic `src` directory structure:
  - `components/` - For reusable UI components
  - `layouts/` - For layout components
  - `hooks/` - For custom React hooks
  - `styles/` - For global styles and themes
  - `utils/` - For utility functions
  - `assets/` - For images, icons, etc.

#### Learning Context
- Understanding component organization in React
- Learning about separation of concerns
- Exploring hooks for custom functionality
- Understanding CSS architecture in React

### Design Documentation
- Created `docs/assets/design-reference/` for design assets
- Documented UI layout in `docs/UI-LAYOUT.md`
- Established design system in `docs/STYLING.md`
- Created component documentation in `docs/COMPONENTS.md`

#### TV-Specific Considerations
- Fixed viewport (1920x1080) for consistent TV experience
- Focus on remote control navigation
- Clear visual hierarchy for 10ft viewing distance
- Accessibility requirements for TV interfaces

### Styling Architecture
- Implemented TV-specific design system
- Created global styles with focus on UX
- Established CSS architecture for scalability
- Set up design tokens and variables

#### CSS Architecture Decisions
- Using CSS variables for maintainability
- Implementing BEM methodology for component styles
- Creating a scalable design system
- Focusing on TV-specific styling needs

### Next Steps
1. Implement Norigin Spatial Navigation
   - Install library
   - Set up navigation context
   - Implement in channel swimlane
   - Test keyboard navigation

#### Learning Goals for Next Steps
- Understanding spatial navigation concepts
- Learning library integration
- Mastering focus management
- Testing and debugging TV navigation

## Development Decisions

### UI Layout
- Horizontal navigation instead of vertical menu
- Single swimlane per category
- Fixed 1920x1080 viewport
- Dark mode implementation

#### Decision Rationale
- Horizontal navigation better suited for TV remote
- Swimlanes provide clear content organization
- Fixed viewport ensures consistent experience
- Dark mode reduces eye strain for TV viewing

### Component Structure
- Focus on reusable components
- TV-specific focus management
- Clear component hierarchy
- Scalable architecture

#### Component Design Principles
- Components should be self-contained
- Focus states must be clearly visible
- Navigation should be intuitive
- Components should be easily extensible

### Navigation Pattern
- Spatial navigation for TV
- Keyboard/remote control support
- Clear focus indicators
- Smooth transitions

#### Navigation Considerations
- Understanding focus management
- Implementing keyboard navigation
- Creating smooth transitions
- Ensuring accessibility

## Challenges and Solutions

### Current Challenges
1. Implementing spatial navigation
   - Learning curve with Norigin library
   - Understanding focus management
   - Testing navigation patterns

2. TV-specific considerations
   - Fixed viewport requirements
   - Remote control navigation
   - Accessibility requirements

### Solutions and Approaches
1. Step-by-step implementation
   - Start with basic navigation
   - Add features incrementally
   - Test thoroughly at each step

2. Documentation and learning
   - Document decisions and rationale
   - Learn from challenges
   - Share knowledge and insights

## Key Takeaways

### Technical Learnings
- TV app development differs from web
- Focus management is crucial
- Spatial navigation requires careful planning
- Component architecture must be TV-friendly

### UX Learnings
- TV navigation must be intuitive
- Visual feedback is essential
- Accessibility is a priority
- User experience must be consistent

## Notes
- Prototype focused on UX over UI
- Browser-based development
- TV-specific considerations
- Scalable implementation for future screens

## Screen Navigation Implementation

### Navigation Architecture Decision
- Implemented screen stack pattern for navigation
- Chosen over simple state management for scalability
- Aligns with TV app navigation patterns
- Supports future screen additions

#### Screen Stack Pattern
```javascript
const [screenStack, setScreenStack] = useState(['home']);
```
- Maintains screen hierarchy
- Enables natural back navigation
- Preserves screen state
- Scales well with additional screens

### Norigin Integration
- Successfully implemented Norigin spatial navigation
- Focus management working with:
  - Keyboard navigation between cards
  - Mouse click focus integration
  - Focus ring styling via component library
- Removed global focus styles to let components manage their own focus

#### Key Implementation Points
1. **Initialization**
   - Single Norigin initialization in `main.jsx`
   - Debug mode for development
   - Visual debug for focus visualization

2. **Focus Management**
   - Root and container elements: `focusable: false`
   - Interactive elements: `focusable: true`
   - Proper focus hierarchy with `FocusContext.Provider`

3. **Screen Transitions**
   - Focus preservation during transitions
   - Proper focus restoration on back navigation
   - Smooth keyboard navigation between screens

### Next Steps
1. Implement screen stack navigation
2. Add ChannelInfo screen
3. Implement Enter/B key navigation
4. Add focus management between screens

#### Learning Goals
- Understanding screen stack patterns
- Mastering focus management across screens
- Implementing TV-specific navigation
- Testing screen transitions
